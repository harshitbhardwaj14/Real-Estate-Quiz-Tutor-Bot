## 📌 What is Real Estate AI Tutor?

The **Real Estate AI Tutor** is an **AI-powered educational system** designed to simulate **real-world, high-stakes real estate assesments**.

Unlike traditional MCQ platforms or static question banks, this system dynamically **generates intelligent exam questions** by analyzing **multiple real property listings simultaneously**, forcing users to reason like licensed professionals.

It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to combine:
- Semantic document retrieval
- Comparative legal and financial reasoning
- Personalized pedagogical feedback

---

## 🧠 Why This Project is Different

### ❌ Traditional Learning Platforms
- Static questions
- Keyword-based search
- No reasoning or adaptive learning

### ✅ Real Estate AI Tutor
- AI-generated scenario-based questions
- Comparative risk assessment
- Adaptive explanations based on user expertise
- Real-world property data reasoning

---

## ✨ Key Innovations

### 🔍 Comparative RAG Engine
Retrieves **up to 3 diverse property listings** (Residential, Commercial, Industrial) and synthesizes **a single exam question** that requires cross-comparison of:
- Legal risks
- Zoning conflicts
- Environmental liabilities
- Financial implications

### 🎯 Adaptive Feedback Loop
The system tracks:
- User experience level (Beginner → Advanced)
- Repeated mistake patterns
- Knowledge gaps

And adjusts:
- Question difficulty
- Explanation depth
- Legal terminology usage

### 🧬 Semantic Search (ChromaDB)
Powered by **vector embeddings**, the system understands **intent**, not just keywords—allowing it to retrieve relevant case studies even when exact terms don’t match.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture (Low-Level Design)

The project follows a clean **Controller–Service–Repository** pattern for scalability and testability.
